# javascript and classes

# javascript have classes 
-  JavaScript classes were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015, making the object-oriented structure easier to work with for developers familiar with class-based programming languages like Java or C++. 
- However, it is important to note that javascript is primarily a prototype-based language.
and these classes are are more of a syntactical convenience (or "syntactic sugar") over its underlying prototype-based inheritance.
- In simple term it has classes but behind the scene it works as prototype-based language.
