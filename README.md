## Control Flows - Quick Guide

for..of => Array, Map
for..in => Object   


forEach  => Map

# Some IMP facts

1. for..in with arrays gives you index values.
2. for..of with map gives you key and values in a list [ 'IN', 'India' ] if we need keys then use for(let   key in map.keys())
3. Can not iterate Map with for..in as Map is not iterable.It wont throw error though but gives nothing as output.
4. forEach wont return anything
